  Wasting food is a common problem in our society. Food waste management is crucial since it can improve our environmental and economic sustainability. We sometimes give money to the homeless to buy food or even buy it ourselves for them. But the idea behind this service was not to buy food but use what is already available in abundance. We have identified the use of mobile technology to reduce food waste management and built an android mobile application that allows individual users, restaurants, farms, grocery stores to donate and share their foods and leftovers with our organization - HelpFeed.
Food Donation App aims to awaken and motivate people to help the needy. It helps the NGOS by finding great daily help restaurants to manage some of their daily meals. This application is aimed to help society and create a sense of solidarity through modern techniques.
